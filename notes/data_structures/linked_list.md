# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

## Key Concepts
- Dynamic size
- O(1) insertion/deletion at head
- O(n) search

## Common Patterns
- Fast and slow pointers
- Reversing a list
- Detecting cycles

## Example Problems
- [Reverse Linked List](../problems/reverse-linked-list.md)
- Linked List Cycle
- Merge Two Sorted Lists
