# Arrays

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures. They store elements in a contiguous block of memory and allow random access by index.

## Key Concepts
- Fixed size (in most languages)
- O(1) access by index
- O(n) search (unless sorted)

## Common Patterns
- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- Prefix sum

## Example Problems
- Two Sum
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- Maximum Subarray
