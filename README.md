# My DSA + LeetCode Notes

[My LeetCode Profile](https://leetcode.com/u/bbharatreddy/)

Welcome to my personal Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and LeetCode Notes repository! This is my journey to mastering algorithms, preparing for coding interviews, and building a strong foundation in problem-solving.

## Why This Repo?
I created this space to:
- Organize my DSA notes in a way that makes sense to me
- Track my progress on LeetCode and other coding challenges
- Quickly look up patterns, approaches, and code snippets
- Reflect on what I’ve learned and how I’ve improved

## Folder Structure
- `notes/` — My topic-based DSA notes (e.g., Arrays, Linked List, Trees)
- `problems/` — Problem write-ups in my own words (e.g., Two Sum)
- `code/` — My code solutions (mostly Python, sometimes others)
- `cheatsheet.md` — My quick reference for common patterns

## How I Use This Repo
- I add notes in `notes/` for each DSA topic as I study or review
- For each LeetCode problem, I write up my approach in `problems/` and save my code in `code/`
- I use `cheatsheet.md` for fast recall of patterns and best practices

## Example
- `notes/arrays.md` — Arrays notes
- `problems/two-sum.md` — Two Sum problem write-up
- `code/two_sum.py` — Python solution for Two Sum
